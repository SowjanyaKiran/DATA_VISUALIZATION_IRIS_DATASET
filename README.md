# 🌼 DATA_VISUALIZATION_ASSIGNMENT_IRIS_DATASET

This project focuses on applying a variety of data visualization techniques to the classic Iris dataset using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. The goal is to visually explore flower measurements and understand how different Iris species differ based on key features.

Dataset: Iris Dataset (multiclass classification dataset)

# Overview:
This notebook showcases multiple visualization techniques, including:

1. Univariate visualizations (histograms, KDE plots, box plots)

2. Bivariate analysis using scatterplots and pairplots

3. Species-level comparison of sepal and petal dimensions

4. Correlation heatmap for overall feature relationships

5. Trend identification using line plots and distribution plots

6. Insights derived visually to understand natural grouping and separation of species
